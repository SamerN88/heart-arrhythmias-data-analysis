## Description
In this independent data analysis of ECG data from over 10,000 patients, I built multiple models that diagnose various heart conditions. The classifiers I used were KNN, decision trees, and logistic regression. My best model was a decision tree that can diagnose a patient with an abnormal heart rhythm, with an accuracy of 94% and a recall score of 0.93.

## Accessing the project
### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook file named `Heart_Arrhythmias_Data_Analysis.ipynb` is the main file where I did all my data science. It's an editable form of the project that contains all the code and explanations. If you scroll down to the last cell, I left the variable names of the three best models in a code cell so you can easily interact with the models without having to look for them.
### PDF
The PDF file named `Heart_Arrhythmias_Data_Analysis.pdf` is simply a PDF version of the Jupyter Notebook; it contains all the code and explanations, except you can't interact with the models.
